# Auto-Encoder Anomaly Detector
This project leverages the power of data analytics, machine learning and deep learning to detect transactional anomalies financial data. The primary challenge in financial transactions lies in the increasing complexity of the data and the consequent rise in the likelihood of errors and faults. To mitigate these risks, a sophisticated anomaly detection model is developed in collaboration with Integrated Digital Systems Fintech (IDS Fintech), a pioneering provider of financial software solutions in the MENA market. The project focuses on developing an anomaly detection model that could effectively identify abnormal transactional behaviors within IDS Fintech's transactional financial data. To achieve this, data analytics and machine learning techniques are harnessed, with a particular emphasis on leveraging an unsupervised Auto-Encoder model. This model, operating without the need for labeled anomalies, effectively learns the underlying structure of normal data by compressing it into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstructing it. Through a comprehensive methodology involving data pre-processing, feature engineering, model testing, fine-tuning, and rigorous evaluation, the Auto-Encoder emerges as the optimal choice for the project's objectives. Its capacity to capture subtle deviations and patterns within the data make it well-suited for the domain, where anomalies manifest in diverse forms, from transaction timing to currency exchange rates to many more contexts. The results of the project showcase the Auto-Encoder's exceptional performance, successfully detecting anomalies while surpassing other unsupervised models. This achievement underscores the model's ability to provide IDS Fintech with an advanced monitoring system to safeguard its transactional processes and financial operations, enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing risks. However, a limitation of the chosen model is its lack of interpretability, as it only identifies the row containing the anomaly without specifying the anomaly's feature within the record. Future research work could explore explainable methods that offer insights into which specific feature within a record is anomalous, as well as techniques for suggesting corrected values.
